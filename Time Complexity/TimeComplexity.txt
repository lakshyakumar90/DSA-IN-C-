- What is Time Complexity ?
  - It is not equal to the time taken to execute. (!= time taken)
  - Rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size
  - Plot it in a graph as time vs input size and the angle (theta) on which the graph increases is called Time Complexity

- Big-Oh Notation O(time)
  - TC to be computed in worst case scenario
  - Avoid constants
  - Avoid Lower values

- Types of TC:
  - big-o - Worst case (Upper Bond)
  - theta - Average Complexity
  - omega - Best case (Worst Bond)


- Space Complexity
  - Memory Space
  - Auxiliary space + Input Space
  - AS - Space that you take to solve the problem
  - IS - Space that you take to store the input

  a and b
  c = a + b
   - c - Auxiliary space 
   - a & b - Input space

SC = O(3)

NOTE:- Never do anything to the input
       Never manipulate the input data
